# Install Pieces repositories


When creating workflows, you might need to install a new Piece repository in order to use a specific Piece that is missing from your workspace.
If you don't know what repository to install, you can check the [**Pieces Gallery**](/gallery) to find the Piece you need and which repository it belongs to.

To incorporate a repository for using a piece within your workflow, follow these simple steps on your Workspace page:

1. **Copy Repository Link:** Obtain the repository link you wish to install from the Gallery.

2. **Access Workspace Settings:** Navigate to the Workspace page and locate the "Repository URL" field.

3. **Paste Repository Link:** Paste the copied repository link into the "Repository URL" field.

4. **Search Repository Versions:** Click on "Search Repository" to explore available versions of the repository.

5. **Select Desired Version:** Choose the preferred version from the list presented.

6. **Add Repository to Workspace:** Click on "Add Repository to Workspace" to complete the installation process.

Your repository is now successfully installed, granting access to the pieces it contains within your workflow.

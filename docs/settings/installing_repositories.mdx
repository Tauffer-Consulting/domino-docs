# Install Pieces repositories


When creating workflows, you might need to install a new Piece repository in order to use a specific Piece that is missing from your workspace.
If you don't know what repository to install, you can check the [**Pieces Gallery**](/gallery) to find the Piece you need and which repository it belongs to.

To install a Piece repository, follow these steps on your workspace settings page:

1. **Copy Repository Link:** Obtain the repository link you wish to install from the Gallery.

2. **Paste Repository Link:** Paste the copied repository link into the `Repository URL` field.

3. **Select Repository Version:** Click on `Repository version` and choose the preferred version from the available options.

4. **Add Repository to Workspace:** Click on `Add Repository to Workspace` to complete the installation process.

Your repository is now successfully installed, granting access to its Pieces, which can now be used in your workflows.

# Domino Python package

Pip installable Python package for the Domino API.

```bash
pip install domino-py
```

The Domino python package brings a collection of convenience classes and functions to work with Domino. See more at `API documentation <https://docs>`_.


## Task (Domino class)


This class defines the objects for each task in the AirfLow dag. Once instantiated it will return either a `DominoKubernetesPodOperator` or a `DominoDockerOperator` object, properly configured with the target Piece arguments, secrets and volume mounts.


## DominoKubernetesPodOperator (Domino class)

This class is an extension of the Airflow's `KubernetesPodOperator` class. It adds Domino specific functionalities and information. Runtime information is passed as ENV variables to the container running the target Piece.


## BasePiece (Domino class)

This is the base class from which every custom Domino Piece should inherit from. It defines the common attributes and methods for all the Domino Pieces.


## CLI

The Domino command line interface helps users to set up and run a local Domino platform, as well as organize and validate their Domino Piece repositories.

# Pieces unit testing

Domino provides a convenient function to test Pieces, the `piece_dry_run` function.

Suppose you created a Pieces repository and want to test the Pieces locally. It's possible to run tests without the whole Domino platform or a new repository release on GitHub.

Pre-requisites:

- `domino-py` installed in your local environment. 
- A local Pieces repository folder, following the standard organization (see [Create Pieces](./create_pieces)).

You simply need to create a script importing the `piece_dry_run` function and fill the arguments with the Piece inputs and secrets:

```python title="testing_piece.py"
from domino.testing.dry_run import piece_dry_run

piece_dry_run(
    repository_folder_path="path/to/pieces_repository",
    piece_name="ExamplePiece",
    input_data={ 
        "in_argument_1": value,
        "in_argument_2": value,
        "in_argument_3": value
    }
    secrets_data={ 
        "EXAMPLE_VAR_1": value,
        "EXAMPLE_VAR_2": value
    }
)
```
The `repository_folder_path` should be the path to the root of the piece repository. 
You can leave it blank and '.' will be considered.

The `piece_name` must be the same defined at the Piece's Folder.

The `input_data` is a dict with the key-value arguments as defined in the Piece's InputModel.

The `secrets_data` is a dict with the key-value arguments as defined in the Piece's SecretsModel.

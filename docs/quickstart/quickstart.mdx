# Quickstart

Fast track for first time users.


## Setup

### Install

<details>
<summary>System dependencies</summary>

In order to run Domino locally, you need to have these dependencies installed:

- **Python** 3.9 or greater.
- **Docker engine** 20.0 or greater. You can install it by following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
- **Docker Compose** V2. You can install it by following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

</details>

In a clean Python environment, install `domino-py` running:

```bash
pip install domino-py[cli]
```

### Run Domino

In a new, empty directory, run:

```bash
domino platform run-compose --github-token <your_github_token>
```
Or run without a github token (some features will not be available).
```bash
domino platform run-compose
```

This command will create the necessary files and directories to run Domino platform using Docker Compose. For more information about this and other modes of running, see [Run Domino](/docs/category/run-domino).

It might take a few minutes to run, specially the first time, since it will download and run a couple of necessary Docker images. Once the platform is up and running, success messages will be printed to your terminal and you will be able to access the Domino GUI at `localhost:3000`.

:::caution
The platform will not be fully functional if you do not provide a github token.
The preferred way to run Domino is passing your token through the `--github-token` flag
:::

## Using the Domino GUI

### Authentication
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="signin" label="Sign In" default>
    Sign In to your Domino's account and start using it. If you don't have an account you can create one or use the default account created automatically by Domino:
    <pre>
      email: admin@email.com 
      <br/>
      password: admin
    </pre>
    <img src='/img/quickstart/signin.gif' alt='signupgif'/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="signup" label="Sign Up">
    Sign up with an email and password of your choice. You will be automatically logged to the Domino GUI.
    <img src='/img/domino_components/gui/signup.gif' alt='signupgif'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>



### Select a workspace

You are now at the Workspaces page. As a new user you get a default workspace from the start, click on the Default card to select it.

You can create more workspaces, configure them and invite other users to collaborate with you later on. 
To return to this page in the future, click on the **Workspaces** button, the first on the left side navigation bar.

![Select workspace](/img/quickstart/select-workspace.png)


### Configuring a workflow

Time to create your first Domino workflow! Click on the **Workflow Editor** button, the third on the left side navigation bar, to open the Workflow Editor page.

This is the space where you will put your ideas into reality. You can drag and drop Pieces from the right side bar to the canvas, connect them and configure them to create any workflow.
For a start, click the **Import** button and then **from examples gallery**. 
Here you will find a few examples of workflows with different levels, that you can use to learn Domino.

![Gallery](/img/quickstart/examples_gallery.gif)

Let's start with a simple one: click on the **Image Filter** card and then **OK** to import it and the workflow template will be imported to the canvas

This workflow is composed by two pieces:
1. **HTTP Request:** Make an HTTP request to an URL and return the result as base64 string. In our case we set a URL to an image.
2. **Image Filter:** Apply a simple filter over the image.

Before effectively creating a workflow you should configure its Settings and Pieces arguments.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="workflowSettings" label="Workflow Settings" default>
    Workflow settings are the settings related to the workflow level, it defines things like the workflow name, 
    how and when the workflow will run, the type of shared storage that should be used to pass data between pieces and others.
    To edit the workflow settings you can click on the Settings button.
    <br/><br/>
    Here is an overview of each workflow property:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Name:</span> This represents the name of your workflow, used for identification within the user interface (UI).
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Schedule:</span> Set the frequency at which your workflow runs in the schedule.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Start Date/Time:</span> Specify the initial date and time when your workflow should begin running.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>End Date/Time:</span> Indicate whether and when your workflow should cease running. If "Never" end date is specified, it will continue indefinitely according to your schedule.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Storage:</span> Select the type of shared storage file system to facilitate data sharing among pieces. 
        When running in compose, the available options are limited to None (no shared storage) or Local (using the local file system). 
        For more information on shared storage, refer to the section on <a href='/docs/quickstart/advanced_concepts/shared_storage'> shared storage </a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img src='/img/quickstart/workflow_settings.gif' alt='workflowSettingsGif'/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="piecesSettings" label="Pieces Arguments">
    To customize the inputs, computation resources, and file system access for each piece, simply double-click on the desired piece. 
    This enables you to easily configure the settings for each step of your workflow.<br/>
    Within this workflow, you can, for instance, edit the input URL for the HTTP Request Piece and define the desired filter in the Image Filter Piece.
    <br/>
      Furthermore, you have the capability to utilize data from the preceding piece as input in the subsequent piece. 
      This is known as upstream data. To enable this functionality, simply check the <span style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>from Upstream</span> checkbox within the downstream Piece. 
      By doing so, you will gain access to a list displaying the preceding outputs that match the expected input data type. Check more about Pieces <a href='docs/pieces/create_pieces'>here</a>
    <img src='/img/quickstart/edit_pieces.gif' alt='editPieces'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Creating a Workflow
Now your workflow is configured you can create it just by clicking on the Create button.
:::info
When creating a workflow, it won't be instantly available for execution. 
The creation process is asynchronous and may take a few seconds to complete."
:::
After creating your workflow you can go to **My Workflows** page to monitor your new workflow.
To do that, click on **My Workflows** button, the second on the left side navigation bar.
![Create Workflow](/img/quickstart/create_workflow.gif)


### Running and Monitoring a Workflow
Perfect, your workflow is now active and ready to run. Even if you've set up a schedule, you can always manually trigger a 
workflow run. Simply click the 'Run' button in the workflows table or select the desired workflow and click the 'Run' button.

Monitoring workflows is made simple and intuitive with Domino. By selecting the desired workflow, you'll be directed to the 
monitoring page. This page provides a comprehensive view, allowing you to monitor the overall status of your workflow, as well as specific Piece logs and real-time results!

This page is divided into 3 sections:

- The top table displays all runs of your workflow.
- The bottom graph visualizes the real-time progress during execution or its final state after the workflow run completion.
- For detailed monitoring of each Piece, including access to logs and results, simply double-click on the desired piece and navigate to the section on the right.

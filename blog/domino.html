After many hours spent crafting functions, meticulously documenting them, ensuring robust error handling, and striving for efficiency, you can finally take a breather and enjoy the satisfaction of your accomplishment. But in the aftermath, you may find yourself pondering:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;If only I could encapsulate these functions as neat modules on my screen, then just drag and drop them whenever I want to use them in future...&quot;</p></blockquote><p>If you&#x27;ve worked with data science, machine learning or a related field, this scenario is likely a familiar one. Well, guess what? Now you can! Domino offers the capability to transform any Python code into modular Pieces that can be seamlessly arranged within an intuitive graphical interface to create powerful  data workflows. </p><p>Domino’s innovative approach not only boosts the efficiency of the workflow creation process, but also encourages a collaborative environment. You can package your well-crafted Python functions into a Piece, complete with its unique data model and isolated execution environment, and share it across your organization, or even beyond. Over time, your colleagues and peers can assemble a rich and diverse toolbox of Pieces, each embodying the expertise of different teams, ready to be pieced together in any number of ways.</p><p>The underlying design of Domino places a strong emphasis on promoting best practices in open-source code sharing. By creating a standard for creating Pieces - reusable modules of Python functions - it encourages you to think modularly, breaking down complex workflows into simple, manageable components. Each Piece is designed to be self-contained, bundled as a container, ensuring not only its portability across systems but also its consistent execution.</p><p>A core element of Domino&#x27;s standard is a well-defined data model for each Piece, which clearly outlines the inputs required and outputs generated. This fosters transparency and understanding among users, making it easier to incorporate into existing or new workflows. It&#x27;s also a boon for documentation, as each Piece can come with detailed notes explaining its purpose, the function it carries out, and the data it works with.</p><p>Furthermore, the Pieces you create can be shared within your organization or published in an open-source repository, inviting contributions and usage from the wider developer community. This approach not only accelerates the spread of innovative solutions and ideas but also enhances the collaborative spirit that is at the heart of open-source culture.</p><p>Domino provides an optimal framework for developers to adhere to best practices of open source code sharing, promoting modular programming and informative documentation. Domino lets you focus on what you do best: writing effective and efficient code to solve complex problems. It takes care of the orchestration, execution, and scalability, and provides a platform for your work to be leveraged and appreciated by others.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-does-domino-do">What does Domino do?<a href="#what-does-domino-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What does Domino do?" title="Direct link to What does Domino do?">​</a></h2><p>At its core, Domino operates as an application on top of Apache Airflow. Domino aims at drastically enhancing the user experience in creating, editing, and monitoring workflows, while still relying on Airflow’s powerful workflow orchestration capabilities. Domino brings the Airflow experience to a whole new level with:</p><ul><li>A GUI-first approach in the creation of data and AI workflows</li><li>Intuitive and rich workflows supervision panels</li><li>The ability to create and distribute plug-and-play modular Pieces</li></ul><p>Let&#x27;s dive deeper into each of these exciting features.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="gui-first-creation-of-workflows">GUI-first creation of workflows<a href="#gui-first-creation-of-workflows" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to GUI-first creation of workflows" title="Direct link to GUI-first creation of workflows">​</a></h3><p>The journey of creating workflows in Airflow can begin quite straightforwardly, but as the complexity scales up, the task can quickly become intimidating. This is where Domino shines, replacing script-writing with an interactive graphical interface that allows you to build and edit workflows with simple drag-and-drop operations.</p><p>On top of that, Domino transcends the language barrier imposed by Airflow&#x27;s Python-writing requirement, thereby empowering even non-developers to tailor data pipelines. Pieces in Domino are interactive nodes that let you manually enter input data and connect output data variables from upstream tasks to input data variables of downstream tasks.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="GIF showing the creation of a workflow in Domino" src="/assets/images/create-workflow-8e6f30b3facc9a9591a95952400299fe.gif" width="1915" height="973" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Domino’s graphical interface brings a breath of fresh air to workflows creation, reducing complex coding processes to simple clicks!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="intuitive-workflows-supervision">Intuitive workflows supervision<a href="#intuitive-workflows-supervision" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Intuitive workflows supervision" title="Direct link to Intuitive workflows supervision">​</a></h3><p>Tired of scourging through a cluttered Airflow UI to find simple information about your dag runs?
